- Step 0 Download required data

- Step 1 Data processing
    - Step 1.1 Run `./DataProcessing/preprocessing_highD.py` to add heading directions of vehicles.
    - Step 1.2 Run `./DataProcessing/extraction_highD_LC.py` to extract trajectories involving lane-changing interactions in the highD dataset.
    - Step 1.3 Run `./DataProcessing/matching_100Car.py` to select applicable crashes and near-crashes in the 100Car NDS data.

- Step 2 Gaussian Process Regression model training
    - Step 1.1 Run `./GaussianProcessingRegression/model_training.py` to train and test the Gaussian Process Regression models.
    - Step 1.2 Use `./GaussianProcessingRegression/model_evaluation.ipynb` to visually evaluate the trained models.

- Step 3 Demonstration part I: conflict probability estimation
    - Step 3.1 Run `./Demonstration/ConflictProbability/pre_computation.py` to pre-compute the parameters of proximity distribution for each time moment in the near-crashes.
    - Step 3.2 Run `./Demonstration/ConflictProbability/collision_warning.py` to perform collision warnings with PSD, DRAC, TTC, and the proposed unified metric, under a variety of thresholds.
    - Step 3.3 Use `./Demonstration/ConflictProbability/result_analysis.ipynb` to find the optimal threshold for each metric.
    - Step 3.4 Run `./Demonstration/ConflictProbability/optimal_warning.py` to perform collision warnings with the optimal thresholds.
    - Step 3.5 Use `./Demonstration/ConflictProbability/result_analysis.ipynb` again to analyse the results together.

- Step 4 Demonstration part II: conflict intensity evaluation
    - Step 4.1 Run `./Demonstration/IntensityEvaluation/lane_change_selection.py` to evaluate the conflict intensity of lane-changing interactions in highD data.
    - Step 4.2 Use `./Demonstration/IntensityEvaluation/result_analysis.ipynb` to analyse the results.

- Step 5 Dynamic visualisation of examples
    - Step 5.1 Run `./Visualisation/video_recoder_100Car.py` to produce images for the dynamic visualisation of near-crashes that have at least one metric failed to indicate a conflict.
    - Step 5.2 Run `./Visualisation/video_recoder_highD_LC.py` to produce images for the dynamic visualisation of some lane-changing interactions in highD data.
    - Step 5.3 Run `./Visualisation/video_maker.py` to generate videos from the images.
    - Step 5.4 Use `./Visualisation/gif_maker.py` to generate gifs from the images (1/4 of the original resolution).
